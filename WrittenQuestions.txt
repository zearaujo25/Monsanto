What is the O() complexity of your solution?
  Considering both the input process and the queue function which checks the bribes, the complexity of this solution is O(n^2)


How can you improve your existing solution? If that is possible, what would your new solution's O() complexity be?
  To improve this solution, instead of reading and only after that checking the status of each queue, the check process could be done while the inputs are been submitted, improving the algorithm complexity from O(n^2) to O(n). 
  

What is the complexity class  (P, NP, NP-complete, etc) of this problem ?
  This problem is a NP class problem since we are trying to validate solutions witha  resolutions time in a polynomial time.
